A new Flutter project.

### Framework
Flutter

### API Endpoints
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

###  Requirements

- Functional Requirements
  - List all /posts paginated, per page or infinite scroll (will need to be done locally because JSONPlaceholder doesn't support paging) ✅
    - Show columns: Post title, Name of the user that posted ✅
    - Clicking a title takes you to the read-only version of the post  ✅
   - Read-only view of a post ✅
   - Ability to create new posts ✅
     - Select a user to have as the poster ✅
  - Ability to be able to edit posts (should be same code as post creation - a bonus for the same page called by a different route) ✅
  - Ability to be able to delete posts ✅
  - Bonus: Act as one of the users. Having posts associated with that user when creating instead of picking one. Blocking editing or deleting of posts that aren't yours. ✅
- Give credit for any code copied from another source ✅
- Doesn’t have to be fancy, needs to be clean and legible but don’t need styles - we’re looking at the functionality ✅
- Be sure that there are clear directions on how to spin up the application ✅
- The minimum number of third-party packages. The reasoning for each package’s inclusion. For example, Vue comes with some stock packages. With Flutter, the Providers package may need to be installed. ✅
